# Project 1: Mood Tracker

The Mood Tracker is a tool for welcoming kids into a new virtual space and checking in with how they are feeling.  Depending on the weather selection and the feeling chosen, they will receive several minutes of content curated for their mood.  If the user (or parent of the user) wants to see the past results, there is "A Look into the past..." section that shows the date, the mood chosen, and the weather on that day.

## About the Project

- The motivation for this project is to support young people in their journey toward emotional maturity by allowing them the oppurtiuunity to develop self-awareness around their own emotional states.
- Built with the following technologies:
    - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - CSS Framework 
    - [bulma-debug.css](https://gist.github.com/JuanVqz/105c4910ff711659059c99492ecd1a5c) used to debug CSS layout
    - [Animista](https://animista.net/play/basic) - CSS Animations 
    - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - [Moments.js](https://momentjs.com/)
    - [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/) API
    - [jokeapi](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) API
    - [favqs](https://public-apis.xyz/favqs-com-2032) API
    - HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- When a weather button is clicked, the data is stored in local storage and the background color and image change, providing a suggestion for what could be done in that weather.
- Once a weather option has been chosen, the user can choose their mood by clicking on one of the four emotions (Angry, Happy, Sad, Calm), the data is stored in local storage and it will bring up a GIPHY and a pun, joke, or quote depending on the emotion chosen.
- The user can cycle through more content of the same emotion chosen by clicking the Next button, or they can close it out and start again.
- **A Look into the past...** section is available for the user to review past selections (date, mood, and weather) from the inputs saved to local storage.
